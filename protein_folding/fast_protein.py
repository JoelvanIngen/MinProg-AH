def fast_compute_bond_score(seq: str, order: Sequence[int]) -> int:
	"""
	Computes the bond score for a protein sequence and order. It uses an
		alternative representation that should be much quicker, but harder to
		expand in the future. However, this is not a problem since it will
		only perform a very specific and small-scoped task.
	This alternative representation uses a dictionary to map node positions to
		their letter. During the creation of this dictionary, we count the
		score that is made up by nodes that are next to each other on the
		protein chain. We do this to compensate for over-counting when we count
		the number of nodes that touch each other, since nodes are
		indistinguishable except for their letter. When counting, we only look
		in specific directions to avoid counting twice (Right, Up and Forward).

	pre:
		- seq is a str containing the molecule letters
		- order is a list of ints containing the shape

	post:
		- an int is returned representing the bond value of this order
